/* Exercise 23 - Troubleshooting Car Issues
An expert system is a type of artificial intelligence program that uses a knowledge base and a set of rules to
perform a task that a human expert might do. Many websites are available that will help you self-diagnose a medical
issue by answering a series of questions. And many hardware and software companies offer online troubleshooting tools
to help people solve simple technical issues before calling a human.

Example Output

Is the car silent when you turn the key? y
Are the battery terminals corroded? n
Replace cables and try again.

Constraint

Ask only questions that are relevant to the situation and to the previous answers. Donâ€™t ask for all inputs at once.

Challenge

Investigate rules engines and inference engines. These are powerful ways to solve complex problems that are based on
rules and facts. Identify a rules engine for your programming language and use it to solve this problem
